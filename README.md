## Typical usage scenario
Visualize all possible options in your user interface, instead of forcing your user to open a pop-up window to reference available options.

## Features and limitations
 
- Displaying the list in a horizontal or vertical direction.
- Option to show a label(as is done for input widgets since Mx 5.18)
- Attaching a microflow on the onchange event.

## Installation
Import the widget to your project and add it to a dataview on a page. Configure the properties to determine how the widget will behave in your application.
